#FizzleToDo

-- This is a c# console application which takes in the users input (does not work in powershell) and creates, stores and serialized task information.
The user can create new tasks, edit existing ones, remove old ones and view all tasks.

All the information is stored in a serialized json file which updates as the user enters or takes away information.
